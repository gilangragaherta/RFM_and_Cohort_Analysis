- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## How to Use

1. **Load Data**: Prepare and load customer transaction data (e.g., CSV file).
2. **Cohort Analysis**: Perform cohort analysis to understand retention rates over time.
3. **RFM Segmentation**: Implement RFM segmentation to classify customers into segments for targeted campaigns.
